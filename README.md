# Pizza-Sales-SQL-Portfolio-Project-

A complete project where I applied SQL queries to analyse pizza sales data, focusing on trends, customer preferences, and inventory management.

Key Results:

●Total Orders Analyzed: Demonstrated the ability to retrieve and aggregate order data.

●Revenue Insights: Extracted total revenue generated from pizza sales through complex queries.

●Pizza Size Analysis: Identified the most common pizza size ordered, showcasing data categorization skills.

●Top 5 Pizza Types: Analyzed order quantities to determine the five most ordered pizzas, reflecting customer preferences.

●Trends and Patterns: Explored order distribution by hour and day, highlighting peak times for pizza sales.

Techniques Utilized:

●Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

●Database creation and table imports

●Joins for comprehensive data analysis

●Analytical and window functions for advanced metrics

🍕 Key Learnings:

●Developed a deeper understanding of SQL and data manipulation techniques.

●Gained hands-on experience with data analysis in a real-world context.

Enhanced skills in creating effective visualizations to communicate data insights.
