A complete project where I applied SQL queries to analyse pizza sales data, focusing on trends, customer preferences, and inventory management.

== Key Results:

  ●Total Orders Analyzed: Demonstrated the ability to retrieve and aggregate order data.
  
  ●Revenue Insights: Extracted total revenue generated from pizza sales through complex queries.
  
  ●Pizza Size Analysis: Identified the most common pizza size ordered, showcasing data categorization skills.
  
  ●Top 5 Pizza Types: Analyzed order quantities to determine the five most ordered pizzas, reflecting customer preferences.
  
  ●Trends and Patterns: Explored order distribution by hour and day, highlighting peak times for pizza sales.

== Techniques Utilized:

  ●Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  
  ●Database creation and table imports
  
  ●Joins for comprehensive data analysis
  
  ●Analytical and window functions for advanced metrics

== Key Learnings:

  ●Developed a deeper understanding of SQL and data manipulation techniques.
  
  ●Gained hands-on experience with data analysis in a real-world context.

Enhanced skills in creating effective visualizations to communicate data insights.

Thank You!!
